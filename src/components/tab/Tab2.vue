      In 1666, one of the most influential scientists in history was strolling
      through a garden when he was struck with a flash of creative brilliance
      that would change the world. While standing under the shade of an apple
      tree, Sir Isaac Newton saw an apple fall to the ground. “Why should that
      apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,” Newton wondered. “Why
      should it not go sideways, or upwards, but constantly to the earth’s
      center? Assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. There must be a
      drawing power in matter.” And thus, the concept of gravity was born. The
      story of the falling apple has become one of the lasting and iconic
      examples of the creative moment. It is a symbol of the inspired genius
      that fills your brain during those “eureka moments” when creative
      conditions are just right. What most people forget, however, is that
      Newton worked on his ideas about gravity for nearly twenty years until, in
      1687, he published his groundbreaking book, The Principia: Mathematical
      Principles of Natural Philosophy. The falling apple was merely the
      beginning of a train of thought that continued for decades.
